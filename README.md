# COM TEAM PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS (JULY 2023 - JUN 2024)
## PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Project Title**: **Team Performance Analysis:"Unlocking Insights for Strategic Growth"**
 Analyse the performance of a team in terms of sponsorships gained and bookings done over a 12-month period (July 2023 to June 2024) to 
•	Show the overall and individual performance
•	Compare actual performance against targets
•	Identify top performers and underperformers
•	Uncover regional and seasonal trends
•	Provide key insights and actionable recommendations to improve team performance
## DATA COLLECTION AND PREPARATION
	Data Source: The dataset was provided in an Excel file, containing monthly performance data for team members, sponsorships gained data, sponsorships targets data, church bookings data, and church booking targets data.
	Data Preparation: The data was cleaned and reshaped using **Power Query** in Power BI to unpivot the monthly data into a long format.
	Calculated columns and measures were created in Power BI using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to analyse performance gaps, tenure, and target achievement rates.
## TOOLS USED AND WHY
•	**Excel**: Used for initial data exploration and cleaning before importing into Power Query to unpivot the data
•	**DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used to create calculated columns and measures for advanced analysis, such as performance gaps, tenure calculations, and target achievement rates.
•	**Power BI**: Used for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards. Power BI was chosen because of its ability to handle large datasets, create dynamic visuals, and share insights easily with stakeholders.
## CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS
•	Top Performers: Geoffrey, Jenny, and Damian consistently exceeded their targets and should be recognized and rewarded.
•	Underperformers: Florence and Colin need targeted coaching and support to close their performance gaps.
•	Regional Strategies: The North region outperformed the South, suggesting the need for regional workshops to share best practices.
•	Seasonal Trends: December was a low-performing month, indicating the need for targeted campaigns during this period.
•	Onboarding Improvements: New hires like Darren showed potential but took time to ramp up, suggesting the need for enhanced onboarding programs.
